(Thanks for the\r\nidea, [jalcine!](http://github.com/jalcine))\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nHere is a very simple example of how the library can be used:\r\n\r\n```xhtml\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n  </head> \r\n  <body>\r\n    <div class=\"ys\" data-stock-ticker=\"GOOG\" data-stock-info=\"LastTradePriceOnly\"></div>\r\n    <div class=\"ys\" data-stock-ticker=\"FB\" data-stock-info=\"Open\"></div>\r\n    <script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"yahoostocks.js\"></script>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order for the program to work, the target divs must have 3 things:\r\n* ``` class=\"ys\" ``` - Tells the program this is a target div\r\n* ``` data-stock-ticker=\"\" ``` - Contains the stock ticker for the stock you want info about\r\n* ``` data-stock-info=\"\" ``` - What info you want about the stock. [Full list here - Use the \"Name\" column](https://code.google.com/p/yahoo-finance-managed/wiki/enumQuoteProperty)\r\n* Note: Each div can currently only contain one ticker and one info param. Support for muliple may be coming in a future version.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you must inlcude [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) if you aren't already. \r\n\r\n## License \r\n\r\n* No Warranty Expressed or Implied. Software is as is.\r\n* [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
